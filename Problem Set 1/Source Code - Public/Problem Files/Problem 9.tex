    Given that if x satisfies \(\displaystyle x^{n}+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{0} = 0\) for some integers \(a_{n-1},\cdots, a_{0}\), \\
    then x is irrational unless x is an integer. \\
    Prove that \(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{2}\) is irrational. \\

    Let \(\displaystyle x = \sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{2}\). Now we see that,
    \begin{align*}
        \displaystyle       \left(x-\sqrt{2}\right)^{3} &= 2 \\
        \displaystyle   x^{3}\sqrt{2}x^{2}+6x+2\sqrt{2} &= 2 \\
        \displaystyle                        x^{3}+6x-2 &= \sqrt{2}\left(3x^{2}-2\right) \\
        \displaystyle       \left(x^{3}+6x-2\right)^{2} &= 2\left(3x^{2}-2\right)^{2} \\
        \displaystyle x^{6}-6x^{4}-4x^{3}+36x^{2}-24x+4 &= 2(9x^{4}+12x^{2}+4) \\
        \displaystyle x^{6}-6x^{4}-4x^{3}+12x^{2}-24x-4 &= 0 \\
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, we have found a monic polynomial with integer coefficients which has \\
    \(\displaystyle \sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{2}\) as its root, meaning by the equation given, \(\displaystyle \sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{2}\) must either be an \\
    integer or irrational number. We can trivially see that \(\displaystyle \sqrt{2}+\sqrt[3]{2}\) is not an integer, \\
    hence it has to be an irrational number.
